# Background

The Diné (Navajo) people have lived in the southwestern United States for at least 1,100 years.  Before the west was invaded by European groups - the Spanish then Americans - the Diné boundaries stretched into the San Luis Valley of Colorado, south to Albuquerque, west to Flagstaff and north into southeastern Utah.  After their defeat by Christopher “Kit” Carson’s armies, the Diné endured the long walk into a smaller territory where their tribal lands were reduced by more than half.  The present day reservation resides at the four corners, with most of the boundary in Northeastern Arizona.  Since their time on the reservation, the Diné people experienced uranium mining and the Gold King Mine Spill with devastating consequences.  Therein lies a resilient nation with a land that still needs remediation and a people who are still healing.

## The Gold King Mine Spill Impacted the San Juan Watershed

In August 5, 2015, near Silverton, CO, a plug broke at the Gold King Mine and acidic water burst out.  The plug was holding back pressurized acidic mine water that had collected behind it. It had been installed along with several other plugs to stop mine pollution from reaching the Animas River.  However, during work by the EPA to build pipes and a pond to release and retain the water, the pressurized plug could no longer hold.  A torrent of water rushed into the Animas River. Soon it joined with the San Juan River and spread like arteries on the land throughout the San Juan watershed (Figure 1.1). It appeared like a scene in Willy Wonka as a butterscotch milkshake rushing through the town of Durango and eventually into Shiprock, a community in Navajo Nation.  But, unlike a milkshake, its contents could harm aquatic life, people, livestock and plants.  “On August 8, Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper declared a disaster as did Navajo President Russell Begaye” (Wikimedia Foundation, 2024).  Officials warned against drinking the water and farmers and ranchers stopped using it.  People were urged to test their water.

The Gold King Mine was in operation from approximately 1893 - 1923.  Many other mines have been in operation around it. All of these mines produce acidic mine tailings that have to be managed to prevent damage to aquatic ecosystems.  There have been question about how the EPA handled the situation and whether the spill could have been prevented.
