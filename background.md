# Research Question

What is the groundwater quantity, quality, and accessibility on the Diné Reservation?

In particular, we want to examine possible consequences from the 2015 Gold King Mine spill and 80 years of uranium mining in the region.

# Background

The Diné (Navajo) people have lived in the southwestern United States for at least 1,100 years.  Before the west was invaded by European groups - the Spanish followed by the Americans - the Diné boundaries stretched into the San Luis Valley of Colorado, south to Albuquerque, west to Flagstaff and north into southeastern Utah.  

After their defeat by starvation and other horrors by Christopher “Kit” Carson’s armies, the Diné endured the long walk to Bosque Redondo. During the 400 mile walk, 2,000 died. Their tribal lands were reduced tremendously and were unsuitable for human occupancy.  

In 1868, the Diné were allowed to return to a part of their original homeland.  

The present day reservation resides at the four corners, with most of the boundary in Northeastern Arizona.  Since their time on the reservation, the Diné people experienced uranium mining and the Gold King Mine Spill with devastating consequences.  Therein lies a resilient nation with a land that still needs remediation and a people who are still healing.

## Timeline

* **1850-Navajo Treaty of 1850**
    * Fighting among the Spaniards, Mexicans, and Diné led to the US relocating the Diné instead of protecting them and the territory they were on as stated in the Treaty of 1850 -Byron Yazzie
    * The Diné were promised protection and a permanent homeland by the US government.
* **1863-1868 - The Long Walk and Captivity at Bosque Redondo**
    * Despite the treaty, the Diné people were forcibly marched to Bosque Redondo. 
    * They experienced “Hwéeldi”- synonymous with misery, starvation, disease, and death to the Diné people.
* **1868-Navajo Treaty: Revised**
    * Initial reserved lands set aside in NM, ending Hwéeldi. 
    * The official “Navajo Reservation” was created.
* **1878-1887 - Executive Order Lands and Dawe’s Act**
    * Presidential EO’s increased the reserved lands for the Diné without imposing additional restrictions.
* **1944-1986 - Uranium Mining on Diné Land**
    * 4 million tons extracted. The contamination spread into homes because materials from mines were used to build homes. Over 500 Abandoned mines are on the reservation today. The mines, both active and abandoned, caused a multitude of health issues that carried on for generations.
* **2015-Gold King Mine Spill**
    * Large quantities of lead, arsenic, cadmium, and other metals were released into the river via acid mine drainage, causing newly planted crops on the reservation to go without irrigation as the headgates for the San Juan River remained closed.


## The Gold King Mine Spill Impacted the San Juan Watershed

In August 5, 2015, near Silverton, CO, a plug broke at the Gold King Mine and acidic water burst out.  The plug was holding back pressurized acidic mine water that had collected behind it. It had been installed along with several other plugs to stop mine pollution from reaching the Animas River.  However, during work by the EPA to build pipes and a pond to release and retain the water, the pressurized plug could no longer hold.  A torrent of water rushed into the Animas River. Soon it joined with the San Juan River and spread throughout the San Juan watershed (Figure 1.1). It appeared like a scene in Willy Wonka as a butterscotch milkshake rushing through the town of Durango and eventually into Shiprock, a community in Navajo Nation.  But, unlike a milkshake, its contents could harm aquatic life, people, livestock and plants.  “On August 8, Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper declared a disaster as did Navajo President Russell Begaye” (Wikimedia Foundation, 2024a).  As headgates of the San Juan River were closed, officials warned against drinking the water and farmers and ranchers stopped using it.  People were urged to test their water.

The Gold King Mine was in operation from approximately 1893 - 1923.  Many other mines have been in operation around it. All of these mines produce acidic mine tailings that have to be managed to prevent damage to aquatic ecosystems (Wikimedia Foundation, 2024a).

## Historic Uranium Mining

In 1948, there was a uranium mining boom, propelled by the US Atomic Energy Commission (AEC).  The commission contracted private companies to mine uranium.  The Navajo Nation lies on the Uranium Belt, wich is part of the Colorado Plateau with uranium imbedded in the sandstone.  The area is ideal for mining the heavy metal.  Eventually, the reservation had 1,000 mines and between 3,000-6,000 workers.

In 1951 health studies began on the reservation by the US Public Health Service, unbeknownst to the Diné people. Uranium mining was linked to many cancers, especially lung cancer.  It has also been found to impact reproductive health and child development among other health concerns.

Uranium mining ended in 2005.


> In 2005, the President of the Navajo Nation, Joe Shirley, Jr., signed the Diné Natural Resources Protection Act which banned uranium mining and processing on Navajo land. After signing the law, President Shirley stated, "As long as there are no answers to cancer, we shouldn't have uranium mining on the Navajo Nation. I believe the powers that be committed genocide on Navajo land by allowing uranium mining” (Wikimedia Foundation, 2024b).

Some superfund sites from the US Environmental Protection Agency exist on the reservation, but much more clean up and remediation of mined lands is needed (Wikimedia Foundation 2024b).

> Today, there are more than 520 abandoned uranium mines on Navajo Nation, and the vast majority of them have not been remediated (i.e., cleaned up and environmentally contained). Roughly half of these mines still have gamma radiation levels more than 10 times the background level. Nearly all are located within a mile of a natural water source. And 17 are just 200 feet away — or less — from an occupied residence. Experts estimate that as a result, 85 percent of all Navajo homes are currently contaminated with uranium (Calvert, 2021).

The map below illustrates how close wells are to uranium mines.
