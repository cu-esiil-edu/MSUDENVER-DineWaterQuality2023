## People, Land and Labor Acknowledgment from MSU Denver

We honor and acknowledge

* The trees, shrubs, plants, plains, waters, and mountains that have sustained the people of the traditional territories and ancestral homelands of the Oglala, Lakota, Cheyenne and Arapahoe Nations.
* This area was also the site of trade, hunting, gathering, and healing for many other Native Nations
* The labor of enslaved Africans and their descendants who worked this stolen land for the colonists
* The communities and families of Auraria who were displaced by the creation of this campus for MSU Denver.
