# Water Quantity on the Diné Reservation

We wanted to look at water quantity to see if there could be a correlation between well depth and well contaminants.  Precipitation and runoff that are recharging wells could carry pollutants into groundwater. Contaminated wells that are being used could harm people, livestock and even become present in agricultural crops.  

“Generally, private wells do not receive the same services that wells supplying the public do. Well owner's are responsible for protecting their drinking water. To do so, a well owner must be aware of their well's potential for contamination and the possible health effects those potential contaminants can have” (EPA, 2024).


## Map of 5 Wells
We chose to analyze 5 USGS wells that are continuously monitored shown in Figure 3.1

> *Figure 3.1 Location of wells monitored by the USGS.*

## How did we map that?

## Graphing Well Depth

Next, we analyzed the water depth at the USGS locations using graphs created through Python coding.  Water depth is the land surface to the surface of the water.  

Two well sites had fairly consistent depths annually between 2006-2022 (Figures 1 and 2).

## How did we code that graph?
