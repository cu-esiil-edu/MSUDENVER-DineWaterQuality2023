# Water Quality on the Din√© Reservation

There are many benchmark indicators of water, such as the amount of turbidity and pH that determine whether water is healthy.  In naturally occurring ecosystems, untouched by human activity, the presence of the indicator, heavy metals, is usually low.  There can be naturally occurring heavy metals in water, however.  The level of heavy metals can have many environmental and health implications.

## Surface Water Samples

We wanted to find out if there were heavy metals in the water on the Dine Reservation and if those heavy metals were there because of the Gold King Mine Spill. We started by examining surface water.  To examine the water quality before and after the Gold King Mine spill, we chose to look at the heavy metal contaminants, Arsenic, Lead, Aluminum, Iron, and Manganese.  Arsenic and Lead are primary pollutants and the others are secondary.  Primary pollutants take a lot less of the pollutant to be dangerous to health than secondary pollutants.  


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Contaminant </strong>(primary pollutants in bold)
   </td>
   <td><strong>EPA limits for safe drinking water</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Arsenic</strong>
   </td>
   <td>10 ppb (parts per billion)
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Lead</strong>
   </td>
   <td>15 ppb
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Aluminum
   </td>
   <td>200 ppb
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Iron
   </td>
   <td>300 ppb
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Manganese
   </td>
   <td>50 ppb
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


Furthermore, we wanted to find out if the heavy metals made the water unsafe to drink.  The EPA sets limits for the amount of contaminant present for drinking water to be safe.  For each metal, we compared the presence of heavy metals to the EPA limit.

## Surface Water Testing Sites Map

There are many EPA water testing sites on the Dine Reservation.  We analyzed data collected at these sites, mapped here:

## Heavy Metal Results Graphs

We chose to look at the monthly maximum readings of each heavy metal as we would not want to drink water where the maximum exceeded the EPA limit.
