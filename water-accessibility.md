## Location of Most Vulnerable Populations

We wanted to find out where the most sensitive people are located on the Diné Reservation and whether they live near well contamination.  To do this, we used US Census Bureau data to look at 3 vulnerable populations, ages 65 and up, women 15-50, and youth under 18. 

### Ages 65 and Up

We chose to look at ages 65 and up because of age-related health factors.  According to the CDC, 

> As people get older, their immune systems do not work as well. Older adults are also more likely to have underlying health conditions. Most deaths from respiratory viruses occur in people older than 65, with risk increasing sharply with advancing age (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2024).

This aging population is especially vulnerable to the effects of heavy metals in water because they have likely been drinking the water for decades.  One metal of concern is arsenic. As discovered in our study of water quality, the EPA defines arsenic that is above 10 parts per billion (ppb) as unsafe. Arsenic was found in the amounts of 40 ppb in the surface water after the Gold King Mine Spill in 2015 and again in 2019 when water levels were high.  

Arsenic is harmful to most of the body systems. The first symptoms of long-term exposure to high levels of arsenic are usually observed in the skin and include pigmentation changes, skin lesions and hard patches on the palms and soles of the feet (hyperkeratosis). The International Agency for Research on Cancer has stated that arsenic in drinking-water is a carcinogenic to humans.  This is partly due to an increased risk of skin cancer in humans with 3 to 4 decades of exposure to contaminated water (Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, 2023a).


People ages 65 and older are a part of the generation that worked in the mines during the uranium mine boom. Many experienced or are currently experiencing repercussions such as lung cancer and liver failure. 

While not all people on the reservation worked in the mines, exposure didn’t just affect miners, it also impacted their families and communities.  A Diné woman described hand washing the yellow powder off of her husband’s clothing after he returned from the mines (Associated Press, 2011).
Others describe swimming in uranium-contaminated ponds and playing with contaminated dirt during childhood. They didn’t know it was dangerous (Calvert, 2021).

There are several products of uranium that can enter into groundwater.  One heavy metal is thorium.  Ingesting thorium can lead to bone and liver cancer.  This is concerning on the reservation as our study found 22 well or spring sites with thorium levels that exceed EPA limits (Figure 4.10).

Radon is another product of uranium.  Houses built on an area with uranium or built with rocks from the uranium mines, can contain high levels of radon as surrounding materials release radon into the air.  Many homes were built with rocks from the mines on the reservation.  Additionally, when uranium is in water, it can release radon into the air.  Dr. Frank Dalichow, the Diné oncologist, remarked ““People don't smoke out here, so where is all this cancer really coming from” (Calvert, 2021)? To some the answer is obvious, breathing in radon is linked to lung cancer in both smokers and non-smokers (Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, 2023b).  It is coming from the uranium mines.
